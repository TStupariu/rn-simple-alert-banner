#rn-simple-alert-banner

This is a sample component I built that us used to display banners in React Native applications.

DISCLAIMER: It should work on iOS/Android, but it;s mostly tested on iOS.

Install:

```npm i --save rn-simple-alert-banner```

No linking required since no native bridges are used.
